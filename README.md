## Description

Blockchain Based Polls is a decentralized voting system built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. This smart contract enables users to create transparent, tamper-proof polls where anyone can participate in voting. The system ensures election integrity by preventing double voting and maintaining all records permanently on the blockchain.

The contract consists of two main functions: creating polls with multiple choice options and casting votes. Each poll stores the question, available options, vote counts, and a list of participants who have already voted. This creates a completely transparent and verifiable voting process that eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries.

## Vision

Our vision is to democratize the polling and voting process by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and accessible platform for decision-making. We aim to eliminate voter fraud, increase participation in democratic processes, and provide a reliable infrastructure for organizations, communities, and individuals to conduct fair and verifiable polls.

We envision a world where every voice can be heard without fear of manipulation, where voting results are instantly verifiable by anyone, and where the barriers to conducting legitimate polls are minimized through blockchain technology.
